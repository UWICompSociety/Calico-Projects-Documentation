#Order of Reading Source Files

For an idea where to get started or where the project is headed check out the project roadmap  https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/blob/master/ROADMAP.md.
For a simpler project to get you started with using react.js components check out https://github.com/ANich/Redux-QuoteGenerator and look at app.js. For more info on node and SPA(Single Page Applications) check out http://www.material-ui.com/#/get-started/prerequisites

#Style Guides

Please follow the coding style of the current code base. Material-UI uses eslint, so if possible, enable linting in your editor to get realtime feedback. The linting rules are also run when Webpack recompiles your changes, and can be run manually with npm run lint.
You can also run linting on a subset of the codebase with gulp eslint:src, gulp eslint:docs or gulp eslint:test. Finally, when you submit a pull request, they are run again by Travis CI, but hopefully by then your code is already clean!

#Examination of key batches of code
There are 2 projects that you can look at to get started. They can be found in the examples folder. These projects are basic examples that show how to consume material-ui components in your own project. The first project uses browserify for module bundling and gulp for JS task automation, while the second project uses webpack for module bundling and building.

The source code for this documentation site is also included in the repository. This is a slightly more complex project that also uses webpack, and contains examples of every material-ui component. Check out the docs folder for build instructions.

#Challenges
* Some of the people working on the projects are very smart and this can be somewhat intimidating.

* Javascript can be a bit intimidating

#Tips
* Pick something small and just get started
* Don't be afraid to ask your mentor for guidance but make sure you at least try something first

#How do I Contribute

* Get to know React before diving into material-ui. Material-UI is a set of React components, so understanding how React fits into web development is important.

* (If you're not familiar with Node, or with the concept of Single Page Applications (SPAs), head over to the documentation website for a quick introduction before you read on.)

* You need preferably a linux os with react and npm installed. Clone the project and get started.
